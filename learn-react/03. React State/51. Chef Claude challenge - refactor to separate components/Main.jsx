     * Challenge: clean up our code!
     * Let's make a couple new components to make things a
     * little cleaner. (Notice: I'm not suggesting what we
     * have now is bad or wrong. I'm mostly finding an excuse
     * to get in some hands-on practice 🙂)
     * 
     * 1. Move the entire recipe <section> into its own
     *    ClaudeRecipe component
     * 2. Move the list of ingredients <section> into its
     *    own IngredientsList component.
     * 
     * While you're considering how to structure things, consider
     * where state is, think about if it makes sense or not to
     * move it somewhere else, how you'll communicate between
     * the parent/child components, etc.
     * 
     * The app should function as it currently does when you're
     * done, so there will likely be some extra work to be done
     * beyond what I've listed above.

                    <h3>Beef Bolognese Pasta</h3>
                    <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
                    <ul>

                        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
                        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
                        <li>1 (28 oz) can crushed tomatoes</li>
                        <li>1 cup beef broth</li>

                        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                        <li>8 oz pasta of your choice (e.g., spaghetti, penne, or linguine)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>Instructions:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for the pasta.</li>
                        <li>In a large skillet or Dutch oven, cook the ground beef over medium-high heat, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, until browned and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Add the diced onion and minced garlic to the skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes, until the onion is translucent.</li>
                        <li>Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 1 minute.</li>
                        <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, beef broth, oregano, and basil. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                        <li>Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
                        <li>While the sauce is simmering, cook the pasta according to the package instructions. Drain the pasta and return it to the pot.</li>
                        <li>Add the Bolognese sauce to the cooked pasta and toss to combine.</li>
                        <li>Serve hot, garnished with additional fresh basil or grated Parmesan cheese if desired.</li>
